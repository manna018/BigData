Using Hive: apache-hive-2.1..0-bin
Here I have mentioned mysql properties but I won't be using them
Hive can have metastore in two ways:
	1)Inside Mysql Db itself
	2)inside a file called metastore_db
Whenever we run hive metastore_db is created.

Hive can be executed over hdfs and yarn layer or any one of them or none of them.
So it may happen that  we create table in hdfs and miss it in metastore_db because we are adding it from different place.


** Remember to add mysql-connector-java-5.1.48.jar in lib
